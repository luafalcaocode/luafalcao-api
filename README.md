# luafalcao-nodejs-api

This repo hosts my personal web site API with functionalities to upload files to the server and send e-mail with user received data 

# Getting Started

- open shell, execute on terminal the command "git clone https://github.com/luafalcaocode/luafalcao-api" and navigate to repo folder
- run npm install
- npm start or f5 for debug
- call an API endpoint using port 4002 for https or 40001 for http (to use https you'll need to configure a certificate key before as I did in development mode. You can use Open SSL to this)
